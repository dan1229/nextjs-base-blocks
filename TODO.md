### TODO

----
#### demo page improvements


##### demo page - `children` props
- what to do about them?
- React.ReactNode ones render weird
- most are useless anyway


##### how to display all props automatically?
- currently they're hardcoded


##### demo page - bbcard 'composite' components
- what to do with header, body and footer?
-
- similar issue with collapsible component
  - even bigger here since collapsible content has specific options
-
- how to handle passing props to children?
  - i.e., 'noPadding' to header/body/footer


##### demo pages - navbar component
- fix links
- add image src
- bbnavbar item - improve component and add children
  - i.e., multiple bbnavbar items


##### demo page - do boolean fields work at all?
- test and if not fix
- some dont
  - bb text - italics field
  - bb card - noborder field


##### demo page - bbmodal demo doesn't work great
- need way to hide modal
- onCancel and onConfirm need to update showComponent state in DemoComponent



##### demo page - show options for props
- props that have options or types should show them
- i.e., bbtext size - show the size 'choices'


##### demo page - rehydration error
- idk fix it


#### demo page - add docs
- add docs / tips for each component
- quick descpription
- specific tips
  - loading spinner - suggest creating a 'wrapper' loader for other loading components
    - or to set a 'default' loading style
  - variables for each component
    - i.e., bbcard has elevation and border thickness





#### bb form demo components
- fix the broken one
- add any missing ones
- generally improve

#### DEMO PAGE IMPROVEMENTS!!! MAKE IT GREAT!!!
- see above
- overall get it working a bit better though



#### convert to app router
- yup

---


#### rename bb dropdown to bb select?
- is that more appropriate
  - def more common name
- then could merge with bb select multiple


#### work on defaults / variables system
- should defaults rely on other vars?
  - should / could the defaults in general be better? theyre awful right now
-
- more broadly what's the deal with these scss variables?
  - there's a lot which is fine
  - need to mark which are 'required'
    - are any other than the 'big colors'?

    

#### improve actual defaults in each component
- try on an app with no global variables set and try to make it look good
-
- update defaults in readme as well







#### bbnavbar 
- vertical mobile styling
  - emulate styling from flutter navbars a bit
    - i.e., always slide out kinda thing
-
- add back 'sticky' prop
  - is it working?



#### bbnavbar item - allow these to just be components instead of strings
- i.e., let me pass a button to a navbar as a child component?
