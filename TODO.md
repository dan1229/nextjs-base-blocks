#### demo page improvements


##### demo page - `children` props
- what to do about them?
- React.ReactNode ones render weird
- most are useless anyway


##### how to display all props automatically?
- currently they're hardcoded


##### demo page - bbcard 'composite' components
- what to do with header, body and footer?
-
- similar issue with collapsible component
  - even bigger here since collapsible content has specific options
-
- how to handle passing props to children?
  - i.e., 'noPadding' to header/body/footer


##### demo pages - navbar component
- fix links
- add image src
- bbnavbar item - improve component and add children
  - i.e., multiple bbnavbar items


##### demo page - do boolean fields work at all?
- test and if not fix
- some dont
  - bb text - italics field
  - bb card - noborder field


##### demo page - bbmodal demo doesn't work great
- need way to hide modal
- onCancel and onConfirm need to update showComponent state in DemoComponent



##### demo page - show options for props
- props that have options or types should show them

##### demo page - rehydration error
- idk fix it


#### demo page - add docs
