# Base Blocks

`Base Block`s is a collection of UI 'blocks' that are used to build the rest of the components used on the sites.

A `block` ideally is the smallest unit of UI code that can be reasonably reused. It is a self-contained piece of code that can be used in any context. It is not a component, but a building block for other, bigger components.

The idea behind this is that you can standardize your components and styling without an overabundance of classes and styles or a third party style library like [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) or [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) (you can still switch to one if you want though!) This will make it easier to maintain and update your codebase as requirements become more intense.
