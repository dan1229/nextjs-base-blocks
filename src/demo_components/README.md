# README - Demo Components

These components are intended to be used in the demo page.

These are NOT intended to be used in production or even another application.

It's primarily meant for the demonstration and testing of the `Base Blocks`/`BBComponents` components.

## Components

- `DemoComponent` - a component that renders a `BBComponent` and a `BBFormComponent` with passed props and allows for the editing of those props.
- `StateEditor` - a pseudo form to edit the state of a `DemoComponent` component. Works arbitrarily with any props.
